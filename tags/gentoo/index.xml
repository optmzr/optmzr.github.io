It's really annoying when viewing some random website and all you see is those boxes instead of the actual symbol. So the first thing to do is to install some fonts that support many code points, like Google's Noto. There's also alot of web pages that use Microsoft's Corefonts.
When it comes to the licensing, Google's Noto is under the SIL Open Font License - which is open source - which is nice.</description></item><item><title>Gentoo with DM-Crypt LUKS and EFI</title><link>https://wstrm.dev/posts/gentoo_with_dm-crypt_luks/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Jun 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://wstrm.dev/posts/gentoo_with_dm-crypt_luks/</guid><description>What?! This article serves as somekind of meta instruction for installing Gentoo with DM-Crypt LUKS. It's my preferred setup with a Gentoo with OpenRC and EFI running on an encrypted harddrive.
The guide is heavily based upon Sakaki's EFI Install Guide.
If this is your first time installing Gentoo it's probably a better idea to follow Sakaki's EFI Install Guide, or follow the Gentoo's Handbook
