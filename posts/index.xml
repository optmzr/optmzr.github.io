During the course Design of Dynamic Web Systems, M7011E at Luleå University of Technoloy, me and another classmate designed and developed a dynamic web system. The project contained both a web server and a dynamic Single Page Application (SPA) front-end. The web server was written in Go from scratch using only the Gorilla libraries for simplifying some parts of the routing. By writing most of the lower level web server logic, such as CSRF token handling, we learned a lot about web server development and the security practices of modern web applications.</description></item><item><title>Better fonts and more symbols with Gentoo</title><link>https://wstrm.dev/posts/better_fonts_and_more_symbols_with_gentoo/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://wstrm.dev/posts/better_fonts_and_more_symbols_with_gentoo/</guid><description>What do I need? It's really annoying when viewing some random website and all you see is those boxes instead of the actual symbol. So the first thing to do is to install some fonts that support many code points, like Google's Noto. There's also alot of web pages that use Microsoft's Corefonts.
When it comes to the licensing, Google's Noto is under the SIL Open Font License - which is open source - which is nice.</description></item><item><title>Creating the real Hyperboria in the North</title><link>https://wstrm.dev/posts/creating_the_real_hyperboria_in_the_north/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://wstrm.dev/posts/creating_the_real_hyperboria_in_the_north/</guid><description>Luleå, Sweden, is actually not that far away from Hyperborea.
Note: I'm actually talking about the Cjdns mesh network, Hyperboria, not any mythical utopia.
Background I've been thinking of running a mesh network since ~4 years ago when I and a classmate had a school project where we tried to make an Cjdns network that was easy to join for everyone using a user friendly captive portal.
So, now I'm at it again, and forcing some friends to participate in a IBSS + B.</description></item><item><title>Gentoo with DM-Crypt LUKS and EFI</title><link>https://wstrm.dev/posts/gentoo_with_dm-crypt_luks/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Jun 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://wstrm.dev/posts/gentoo_with_dm-crypt_luks/</guid><description>What?! This article serves as somekind of meta instruction for installing Gentoo with DM-Crypt LUKS. It's my preferred setup with a Gentoo with OpenRC and EFI running on an encrypted harddrive.
The guide is heavily based upon Sakaki's EFI Install Guide.
If this is your first time installing Gentoo it's probably a better idea to follow Sakaki's EFI Install Guide, or follow the Gentoo's Handbook
